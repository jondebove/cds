# cds

Simple generic C99 data structures:

- Dynamic array (`darray`)
- Dynamic string (`dstring`)
- Hash table (`htable`)

The structures are basic but pretty fast.
Genericity is achieved using `void *`, so the compiler will not help you.

## Usage

Just copy paste the `.c` and `.h` files you need in your project.

Look at the files `*_test.c` to see examples.
